# Visualizing American Sign Language
The "Sign Language MNIST Dataset" offers an alternative to the MNIST dataset for tasks related to hand gesture recognition. It comprises images depicting hand gestures that correspond to individual letters in American Sign Language (ASL). This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models designed to recognize and interpret ASL gestures, facilitating advancements in sign language recognition technology. Accessible through Kaggle, researchers and developers can utilize this dataset to develop innovative solutions for bridging communication barriers and promoting inclusivity in technology.You can access the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist).
